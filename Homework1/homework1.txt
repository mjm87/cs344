Introspection as I understand it has largely been abandoned by psychology in any attempt to further our understanding of our own minds. It appears that we are not actually well enough aware of our own mental processes to explain them in a way that science can take advantage of. If it doesn't seem useful to psychology, I have a feeling it would prove quite challenging to attempt to describe our mental processes in a way that an AI could make better sense of it. One challenge would simply be the transcription. We could write down our thoughts, and perhaps an AI could do something with them or generate similar-ish thoughts, but the input/output seems to be limited to text-based interfaces which seem quite limiting for any useful applications. However even if we could get a computer to generate similar such "thoughts" I suspect that the actual generation of the thoughts in our brains is beneath the thought-level that we typically have access to and is reliant on subconscious processes that would be missing in an AI built off of surface level thoughts.
