Questions:

a. Submit solutions to tasks 1â€“3.

    Task 1:

        california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"]

    Task 2:

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.scatter(calibration_data.predictions, calibration_data.targets)

    Task 3:

        california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: max(x, 0.05))
        plt.subplot(1,2,2)
        _ = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].hist()

b. What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?

    So presumably we're introducing synthetic features (like rooms_per_person) to increase the performance and
    fit the regresssion line to the data. Typically, I would hope that we're not just randomly trying different
    synthetic features, but that we at least have a hypothesis for why this manipulation on the data makes sense.
    In some cases, this might simply be because the data we were able to collect wasn't something that we could
    directly collect but could be calculated or approximated from collectable data.

c. What are outliers and what is typically done with them?

    Outliers are data points that fall outside the regular range of values expected. They're typically considered
    mistakes or extreme cases that can be more or less ignored, like we're doing here.
