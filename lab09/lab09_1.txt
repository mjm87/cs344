How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?

Poorly. There doesn't seem to be any consensus as the RMSE continues to go up and down over the 8 periods.

Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.

    L2 Loss doesn't penalize mis-classifications when output is interpreted as a probability.
    LogLoss however much more heavily penalizes these 'confidence errors' which can be a good or
    bad thing depending on the problem.

Task2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.

    It does begin to level off with less chaotic fluctuations, though there does still appear to be a not insignificant
    difference between the training and validation sets.

Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.

AUC: 0.79
accuracy: 0.77
