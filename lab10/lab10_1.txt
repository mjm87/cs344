a. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

I would definitely prefer using Keras. Looking through all the code necessary to get a simple model running in
Tensorflow is not pretty. It's slightly convenient to be able to specify the layers in the array format here,
but reading somebody else's code, I think I prefer Kera's stack of layers for readability purposes.

b. Tasks 1:

    Mine:

    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units = [10,20,30,40]

    training RMSE: 100.73
    validation RMSE: 101.82

    Theirs:

    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[10, 10]

    training RMSE: 102.20
    validation RMSE: 108.79
