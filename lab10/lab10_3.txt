a. Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?

    Primarily it appears that the model predicts the true value (the diagonal is pretty black),
    however, there is some slight confusion with some values, perhaps 20% of the time a 4 might 
    be mistrued for a 9 or a 5 for an 8.

b. Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? 
           Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.

    Code-wise the Keras example is unsurprisingly much simpler. The TensorFlow network appears to have two hidden layers of 100 nodes each
    which seems to be quite a bit larger than the Keras example with only 512 nodes on one layer.

    Given an accuracy of .95 as the baseline, I'm quite happy with that.
    The one thing I might try would be some form of early stopping, since the LogLoss graph
    is showing the training logloss beginning to diverge from the validation logloss after a period or so.

c. Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?

    Strangely I can't seem to find the right parameters for the steps. It appears that the defaults were already using
    1000 steps, but even after bumping up the steps to 100,000 I wasn't seeing anything different in the plots. They
    all just looked sort of blurry features. I fancy I can see parts of numbers, but mostly it's just a little line
    or a little curve. That's the same for both levels I was able to look at.
