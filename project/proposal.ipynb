        "While I'm not totally set on the project, the project I've been considering for a while is tackling the Obstacle Tower Challenge a benchmarking challenge built by Unity3d to help AI researchers have an environment to play with. From my understanding, the goal is to develop an AI that is able to guide a player through a tower of 100 different procedurally generated levels, solving simple puzzles, with the primary input being the pixels that a player would see on the screen. More information can be found here: https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/02/18/the-obstacle-tower-challenge-is-live. I definitely don't have any hope of winning the challenge, but would be interested at trying my hand on the project. \n",

        "While I haven't dug too far into the sample code, it appears that there is a python api they've made available for training agents and some basic stuff to get started. \n",
        "As far as technologies involved, I'm guessing a little research into reinforced learning will be appropriate as well as potentially looking into some of the variations suggested in Unity's research paper they produced."
